Media player does the control operations like Volume, Forward, Rewind and Play/Pause as per gesture provided.

## Synopsis

Aim of this project was to make a **gesture controlled system** to control the media player on the computer without using keyboard or mouse. This is achieved using hardwares such as Arduino, USB cable (type A to type B), two Ultrasonic Sensors and Jumper wires and a Breadboard.

## Requirements

1. 2 X  Ultrasonic Sensors
2. Arduino
3. Some Jumper wires
4. Sticky Tape

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

**Convinience** and **ease** of access to the user while entertainment was the sole motivation for the creation of this project.

## Installation

Arduino IDE
Python modules used:
* serial
* time
* pyautogui

Make sure that you have installed these modules installed.
